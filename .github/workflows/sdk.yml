          # So, why do we run this twice?
          # The reason is that we run prepare.py which deletes some unneeded (& breaking) sources from GFX library.
          # However, this step breaks build dependencies for current run, so we need to re-run the build again.
          # This is ugly, I know. But this is only required to build the lib independently, and we only do this in Github action.
          # So nobody will every know we do this ugly hack! Unless they read this note, of course. :D
